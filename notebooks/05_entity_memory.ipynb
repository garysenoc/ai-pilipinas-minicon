        "- Explicitly tracks important entities and facts\n",
        "- Good for remembering user preferences and details\n",
        "- Structured memory format\n",
        "- Can query specific entities\n",
        "- Uses modern LangChain v1.0+ patterns (no deprecation warnings)\n",

        "## Cons\n",

        "- May miss non-entity context\n",
        "- Requires entity extraction (can be imperfect)\n",
